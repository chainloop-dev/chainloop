# Chainloop Module for Dagger

![dagger-tested-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/dagger%20version-v0.10.0-green)

Daggerized version of [Chainloop](https://docs.chainloop.dev) that can be used to attest and collect pieces of evidence from your [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- This module requires existing familiarity with Chainloop and its attestation process. Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting) to learn more.
- You need a `token` (aka workflow robot account) [previously generated](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/workflow-definition#robot-account-creation) by your Chainloop administrator.

## Attestation Crafting

The [attestation process](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting) starts with its initialization (`init`) or `resume`, then adding as many materials/pieces of evidence as needed (`add-raw-evidence` or `add-file-evidence`), and finally, signing and pushing the attestation to the Chainloop control plane (`push`).

You can invoke this module in two ways: either from the Dagger CLI `dagger call ...` or from your own Dagger pipeline by importing this module as a dependency.

### Using the Chainloop module in your Dagger pipeline

To use Chainloop in your module, first, you need to add it as a dependency.

```sh
dagger install github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop
```

Once done, you'll have access to the Chainloop client via `dag.Chainloop()` and start the attestation process with Init().

You can find a full example of how to integrate attestation crafting in your `Go` pipeline [here](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/integration-demo/blob/main/chainloop-demo/dagger/src/main.go)

### Using the Dagger CLI

The [attestation process](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting) starts with its initialization (`init`) or `resume`, then adding as many materials/pieces of evidence as needed (`add-raw-evidence` or `add-file-evidence`), and finally, signing and pushing the attestation to the Chainloop control plane (`push`).

This module is designed to support function chaining, so after initializing the attestation, you can chain the subcommands to add pieces of evidence and push the attestation. For example

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  # Initialize the command
  init --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN \
  # we chain subcommands after the initialization
  # add a raw evidence
  add-raw-evidence --name my-evidence --value "my-value" \
  # and push the result
  push --key file:/path/to/cosign.key --passphrase env:COSIGN_PASSPHRASE
```

If the attestation process end-to-end is not completed in one go, you can store the attestation-id after init and resume the attestation process using the `resume` method at any time down the line.

```sh
# Initialize but this time we store the attestation-id
ATTESTATION_ID=$(dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop  init --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN attestation-id)


# and we use it to resume the attestation process
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  # we chain subcommands after the initialization
  ....
```

#### 1 - Init attestation ([docs](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting#initialization))

Initialize an attestation using the Chainloop token stored in the `CHAINLOOP_TOKEN` environment variable.

> NOTE: `--token` can be provided only by referencing an environment variable (env:MY_VAR), not by value

```sh
# Initialize the attestation and get its ID
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  init \
  --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN \
  --repository /path/to/repo \ # optional flag to automatically attest a Git repository
  --contract-revision 1 # optional flag to specify the revision of the Workflow Contract (default `latest`)
```

#### 2 - Get the status ([docs](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting#inspecting-the-crafting-status))

Resuming a previous attestation

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  status
```

or chaining the command right after initialization

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  init --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN \
  status
```

#### 3 - Add pieces of evidence ([docs](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting#adding-materials))

You can attest pieces of evidence by providing its material name and its value, either in the form of a path to a file (`--path`) or a raw value (`--value`).

A path to a file is required for materials derived from artifacts, such as Software Bill Of materials, or any other file-based evidence.

```sh
# Provide a material of kind artifact through its path
# Remember, we first resume the attestation or chain the commands
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  add-file-evidence --name my-sbom --path ./path/to/sbom.json
```

```sh
# Or one with a raw value such as a container image reference
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  add-raw-evidence --name my-container-image --value ghcr.io/chainloop-dev/chainloop/control-plane
```

In some cases, you might be providing a private container image as a piece of evidence. In this case, you'll also need to preload the container registry credentials.

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  # Now load the registry credentials
  with-registry --address ghcr.io --username my-username --password MY_PAT_TOKEN \
  # And perform the attestation of the private container image
  add-raw-evidence --name my-container-image --value ghcr.io/chainloop-dev/chainloop/control-plane
```

#### 4 - Sign and push attestation ([docs](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting#encode-sign-and-push-attestation))

Sign and push the attestation using a cosign **key stored in a file** and a passphrase stored in an environment variable.

> NOTE: neither --signing-key nor --passphrase can be provided by value. You need to provide them either as a file (file:/) or an environment variable (env:/).

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  push --key file:/path/to/cosign.key --passphrase env:COSIGN_PASSPHRASE
```

Alternatively, you can also provide the signing key in an environment variable `--key env:MY_COSIGN_KEY`

#### 5 - Cancel/mark attestation as failed

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  mark-failed --reason "Something went wrong"
```

or cancel the attestation process

```sh
dagger call -m github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop \
  resume --token env:CHAINLOOP_TOKEN --attestation-id $ATTESTATION_ID \
  mark-canceled --reason "nothing to see here"
```
