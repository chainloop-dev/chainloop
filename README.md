# Chainloop

> Chainloop is under active development and you should expect breaking changes before the first stable release.

## What is it?

Chainloop is an open source software supply chain control plane, a single source of truth for artifacts plus a declarative attestation process.

With Chainloop, SecOps teams can declaratively state the attestation and artifacts expectations for their organizationâ€™s CI/CD workflows, while also resting assured that latest standards and best practices are put in place.

Developer teams, on the other hand, do not need to become security experts, the attestation crafting tool will guide them with guardrails and a familiar developer experience.

To learn more about the project motivation please look at [this blog post](https://docs.chainloop.dev/blog/introducing-chainloop) and see it in action in [this video](https://docs.chainloop.dev/blog/software-supply-chain-attestation-easy-way#see-it-in-action).

## Getting started

See the getting started [guide](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/installation) for detailed information on downloading and configuring the Chainloop Command Line Interface (CLI)

In a nutshell:

```bash
$ curl -sfL https://docs.chainloop.dev/install.sh | bash -s

$ chainloop auth login
```

> NOTE: You can also build and run Chainloop [from source](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Once you've been logged in, follow [these instructions](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/setup) to learn how to set up your account.

## How does it work?

### Compliant Single Source of Truth

Craft and store attestation metadata and artifacts via a single integration point regardless of your CI/CD provider choice.

![Chainloop Overview](./docs/img/overview-1.png)

The result is having a SLSA level 3 compliant single Source of truth for artifacts and attestation built on OSS standards such as [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/), [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/), [SLSA](https://slsa.dev) and [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md).

Chainloop also makes sure the crafting of artifacts and attestation follows **best practices and meets the requirements** declared in their associated Workflow Contract.

### Declarative, contract-based attestation

One key aspect is that in Chainloop, CI/CD integrations are declared via [**Workflow Contracts**](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/workflow-definition#workflow-contracts).

A [Workflow Contract](https://docs.chainloop.dev/reference/operator/contract) gives operators **full control over what kind of data (build info, materials) must be received as part of the attestation and the environment where these workflows must be executed at**. This enables an easy, and maintainable, way of propagating and enforcing requirements downstream to your organization.

You can think of it as an [**API for your organization's Software Supply Chain**](https://docs.chainloop.dev/reference/operator/contract) that both parties, development and SecOps teams can use to interact effectively.

### Third-Party Integration fan-out

Operators can set up third-party integrations such as [Dependency-Track](https://docs.chainloop.dev/guides/dependency-track) for SBOM analysis or an OCI registry for storage of the received artifacts and attestation metadata.

Ops can mix and match with different integrations while **not requiring developers to make any changes on their side**!

### Role-tailored experience

Chainloop makes sure to clearly define the responsibilities, experience and functional scope of the **two main personas, Security/Operation (SecOps) and Development/Application teams**.

SecOps are the ones in charge of defining the Workflow Contracts, setting up third-party integrations, or having access to the control plane where all the Software Supply Chain Security bells and whistles are exposed.

Development teams on the other hand, just need to integrate Chainloop's jargon-free [crafting tool](https://docs.chainloop.dev/getting-started/attestation-crafting) and follow the steps via a familiar DevExp to make sure they comply with the Workflow Contract defined by the SecOps team. No need to learn in-toto, signing, SLSA, OCI, APIs, nada :)
