Starting with Chainloop [0.93.8](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/releases/tag/v0.93.8), operators can attach policies to contracts. 
These policies will be evaluated against the different materials and the statement metadata, if required. The result of the evaluation is informed as a list of possible violations and added to the attestation statement
before signing and sending it to Chainloop. 

Currently, policy violations won't block `attestation push` commands, but instead, we chose to include them in the attestation so that they can 
be used for building server side control gates.

### Policy specification
A policy can be defined in a YAML document, like this:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cyclonedx-licenses.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {PolicyYAML}
</CodeBlock>

In this particular example, we see:
* policies have a name (cyclonedx-licenses)
* they can be optionally applied to a specific type of material (check [the documentation](./operator/contract#material-schema) for the supported types). If no type is specified, a material name will need to be provided explicitly in the contract.
* they have a policy script that it's evaluated against the material (in this case a CycloneDX SBOM report). Currently, only [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego) policies are supported.

Policy scripts could also be specified in a detached form:
```yaml
...
spec:
  type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  path: my-script.rego
```

### Applying policies to contracts
When defining a contract, a new `policies` section can be specified. Policies can be applied to any material, but also to the attestation statement as a whole.
```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
materials:
  - name: sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: another-sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: my-image
    type: CONTAINER_IMAGE
policies:
  materials: # policies applied to materials
    - ref: cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # (1)
  attestation: # policies applied to the whole attestation
    - ref: https://github.com/chainloop/chainloop-dev/blob/main/docs/examples/policies/chainloop-commit.yaml # (2)
```
Here we can see that:
- (1) materials will be validated against `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy. But, since that policy has a `type` property set to `SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON`, only SBOM materials (`sbom` and `another-sbom` in this case) will be evaluated. 
  
  If we wanted to only evaluate the policy against the `sbom` material, and skip the other, we should filter them by name:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: cyclonedx-licenses.yaml
        selector: # (3)
          name: sbom
  ```
  Here, in (3), we are making explicit that only `sbom` material must be evaluated by the `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy.
- (2) the attestation in-toto statement as a whole will be evaluated against the remote policy `chainloop-commit.yaml`, which has a `type` property set to `ATTESTATION`. 
  This brings the opportunity to validate global attestation properties, like annotations, the presence of a material, etc. You can see this policy and other examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/tree/main/docs/examples/policies).

Finally, note that material policies are evaluated during `chainloop attestation add` commands, while attestation policies are evaluated in `chainloop attestation push` command.

### Embedding or referencing policies
There are two ways to attach a policy to a contract:
* **By referencing it**, as it can be seen in the examples above. `ref` property admits a local (filesystem) or remote reference (HTTPS). For example:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials: 
      - ref: cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # local reference
  ```
  and
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: https://github.com/chainloop/chainloop-dev/blob/main/docs/examples/policies/cyclonedx-licenses.yaml
  ```
  are both equivalent. The advantage of having remote policies is that they can be easily reused, allowing organizations to create policy catalogs.

* If preferred, authors could create self-contained contracts **embedding policy specifications**. The main advantage of this method is that it ensures that the policy source cannot be changed, as it's stored and versioned within the contract:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cyclonedx-licenses.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {PolicyYAML}
</CodeBlock>

In the example above, we can see that, when referenced by the `policy` attribute (1), a full policy can be embedded in the contract.
  
### Rego scripts
Currently, policy scripts are assumed to be written in [Rego language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego). Other policy engines might be implemented in the future.
The only requirement of the policy is the existence of one or multiple `deny` rules, which evaluate to a **list of violation strings**.
For example, this policy script:
```yaml
package main

deny[msg] {
  not is_approved
  
  msg:= "Container image is not approved"
}

is_approved {
  input.predicate.materials[_].annotations["chainloop.material.type"] == "CONTAINER_IMAGE"
  
  input.predicate.annotations.approval == "true"
}
```
when evaluated against an attestation, will generate the following output if the expected annotation is not present:
```json
{
    "deny": [
        "Container image is not approved"
    ]
}
```
Make sure you test your policies in https://play.openpolicyagent.org/, since you might get different results when using Rego V1 syntax, as there are [some breaking changes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/opa-1/).
