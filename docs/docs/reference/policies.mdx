Starting with Chainloop [0.93.8](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/releases/tag/v0.93.8), operators can attach policies to contracts. 
These policies will be evaluated against the different materials and the statement metadata, if required. The result of the evaluation is informed as a list of possible violations and added to the attestation statement
before signing and sending it to Chainloop. 

Currently, policy violations won't block `attestation push` commands, but instead, we chose to include them in the attestation so that they can 
be used for building server side control gates.

## Policy specification
A policy can be defined in a YAML document, like this:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cyclonedx-licenses.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {PolicyYAML}
</CodeBlock>

In this particular example, we see:
* policies have a name (cyclonedx-licenses)
* they can be optionally applied to a specific type of material (check [the documentation](./operator/contract#material-schema) for the supported types). If no type is specified, a material name will need to be provided explicitly in the contract.
* they have a policy script that it's evaluated against the material (in this case a CycloneDX SBOM report). Currently, only [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego) policies are supported.

Policy scripts could also be specified in a detached form:
```yaml
...
spec:
  type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  path: my-script.rego
```

## Applying policies to contracts
When defining a contract, a new `policies` section can be specified. Policies can be applied to any material, but also to the attestation statement as a whole.
```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
materials:
  - name: sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: another-sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: my-image
    type: CONTAINER_IMAGE
policies:
  materials: # policies applied to materials
    - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # (1)
    # or optionally with the digest appended, see integrity checks below
    # - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
  attestation: # policies applied to the whole attestation
    - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/chainloop-commit.yaml # (2)
```
Here we can see that:
- (1) materials will be validated against `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy. But, since that policy has a `type` property set to `SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON`, only SBOM materials (`sbom` and `another-sbom` in this case) will be evaluated. 
  
  If we wanted to only evaluate the policy against the `sbom` material, and skip the other, we should filter them by name:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml
        selector: # (3)
          name: sbom
  ```
  Here, in (3), we are making explicit that only `sbom` material must be evaluated by the `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy.
- (2) the attestation in-toto statement as a whole will be evaluated against the remote policy `chainloop-commit.yaml`, which has a `type` property set to `ATTESTATION`. 
  This brings the opportunity to validate global attestation properties, like annotations, the presence of a material, etc. You can see this policy and other examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/tree/main/docs/examples/policies).

Finally, note that material policies are evaluated during `chainloop attestation add` commands, while attestation policies are evaluated in `chainloop attestation push` command.

### Embedding or referencing policies
There are two ways to attach a policy to a contract:
* **By referencing it**, as it can be seen in the examples above. `ref` property admits a local `file://` (filesystem) or remote reference `https://`. For example:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials: 
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # local reference
  ```
  and
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/sbom/cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml
  ```
  are both equivalent. The advantage of having remote policies is that they can be easily reused, allowing organizations to create policy catalogs.

* If preferred, authors could create self-contained contracts **embedding policy specifications**. The main advantage of this method is that it ensures that the policy source cannot be changed, as it's stored and versioned within the contract:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cyclonedx-licenses.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {PolicyYAML}
</CodeBlock>

In the example above, we can see that, when referenced by the `policy` attribute (1), a full policy can be embedded in the contract.

### Policy arguments
Policies may accept arguments to customize its behaviour. See this policy that matches a "quality" score against a "threshold" argument:
```yaml
# quality.yaml
apiVersion: workflowcontract.chainloop.dev/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: quality
  description: Checks for components without licenses
  annotations:
    category: sbom
spec:
  type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  embedded: |
    package main

    import rego.v1

    default threshold := 5
    threshold := to_number(input.args.threshold) # (1)

    violations contains msg if {
      input.score < threshold
      msg := sprintf("quality threshold not met %d < %d", [input.score, threshold])
    }
```

It can be instantiated with a custom `threshold` parameter, by adding a `with` property in the policy attachment in the contract:
```yaml
policies:
  materials:
    - ref: file://quality.yaml
      with:
        threshold: 6 (1)
```
(1) This is interpreted as a string, that's why we need to add `to_number` in the policy script

### Integrity Checks

Optionally, you can append the sha256 hash of the policy file content to your policy attachment reference. By doing so, the policy engine will make sure the resolved policy matches the expected hash in the contract reference.

For example

  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials: 
      # append digest to optionally check the integrity of the policy file during evaluation
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
      # It also works for http references
      - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/sbom/cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
  ```

## Policy scripts format (REGO)
Currently, policy scripts are assumed to be written in [Rego language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego). Other policy engines might be implemented in the future.
The only requirement of the policy is the existence of one or multiple `violations` rules, which evaluate to a **set of violation messages**.
For example, this policy script:
```yaml
package main

import rego.v1

violations contains msg if {
  not is_approved
  
  msg:= "Container image is not approved"
}

is_approved if {
  some material in input.predicate.materials
  material.annotations["chainloop.material.type"] == "CONTAINER_IMAGE"
  
  input.predicate.annotations.approval == "true"
}
```
when evaluated against an attestation, will generate the following output if the expected annotation is not present:
```json
{
    "violations": [
        "Container image is not approved"
    ]
}
```
Make sure you test your policies in https://play.openpolicyagent.org/, since you might get different results when using Rego V1 syntax, as there are [some breaking changes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/opa-1/).
