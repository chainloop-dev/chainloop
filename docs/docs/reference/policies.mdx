You can use policies to implement control gates and security checks in your attestations.

Operators can attach policies to workflow contracts. Those policies will be evaluated against the different materials and the statement metadata. The result of the evaluation is informed as a list of possible violations and added to the attestation statement
before signing and sending it to Chainloop.

Currently, policy violations won't block `attestation push` commands. Instead, Chainloop will include them in the attestation so that they can be used for building server side control gates.

## Policy specification
A policy can be defined in a YAML document, like this:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cyclonedx-licenses.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {PolicyYAML}
</CodeBlock>

In this particular example, we see:
* policies have a name (cyclonedx-licenses)
* they can be optionally applied to a specific type of material (check [the documentation](./operator/contract#material-schema) for the supported types). If no type is specified, a material name will need to be explicitly set in the contract, through selectors.
* they have a policy script that it's evaluated against the material (in this case a CycloneDX SBOM report). Currently, only [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego) language is supported.
* there can be multiple scripts, each associated with a different material type.

Policy scripts could also be specified in a detached form:
```yaml
...
spec:
  policies:
  - kind: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
    path: my-script.rego
```

### Supporting multiple material types
Policies can accept multiple material types. This is specially useful when a material can be specified in multiple format types, but from the user perspective, we still want to maintain one single policy.

For example, this policy would check for vulnerabilities in SARIF, CycloneDX and CSAF formats:
```yaml
...
apiVersion: workflowcontract.chainloop.dev/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: cve-policy
spec:
  policies:
    - kind: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
      path: cves-cyclonedx.rego
    - kind: CSAF_SECURITY_ADVISORY
      path: cves-csaf-sa.rego
    - kind: SARIF
      path: cves-sarif.rego
```
In these cases, Chainloop will choose the right script to execute, but externally it would be seen as a single policy.
If more than one path is executed (because they might have the same `kind`), the evaluation result will be the sum of all evaluations.

## Applying policies to contracts
When defining a contract, a new `policies` section can be specified. Policies can be applied to any material, but also to the attestation statement as a whole.
```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
materials:
  - name: sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: another-sbom
    type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  - name: my-image
    type: CONTAINER_IMAGE
policies:
  materials: # policies applied to materials
    - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # (1)
    # or optionally with the digest appended, see integrity checks below
    # - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
  attestation: # policies applied to the whole attestation
    - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/chainloop-commit.yaml # (2)
```
Here we can see that:
- (1) materials will be validated against `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy. But, since that policy has a `type` property set to `SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON`, only SBOM materials (`sbom` and `another-sbom` in this case) will be evaluated. 
  
  If we wanted to only evaluate the policy against the `sbom` material, and skip the other, we should filter them by name:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml
        selector: # (3)
          name: sbom
  ```
  Here, in (3), we are making explicit that only `sbom` material must be evaluated by the `cyclonedx-licenses.yaml` policy.
- (2) the attestation in-toto statement as a whole will be evaluated against the remote policy `chainloop-commit.yaml`, which has a `type` property set to `ATTESTATION`. 
  This brings the opportunity to validate global attestation properties, like annotations, the presence of a material, etc. You can see this policy and other examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/tree/main/docs/examples/policies).

Finally, note that material policies are evaluated during `chainloop attestation add` commands, while attestation policies are evaluated in `chainloop attestation push` command.

### Embedding or referencing policies
There are two ways to attach a policy to a contract:
* **By referencing it**, as it can be seen in the examples above. `ref` property admits a local `file://` (filesystem) or remote reference `https://`. For example:
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials: 
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-licenses.yaml # local reference
  ```
  and
  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials:
      - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/sbom/cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml
  ```
  are both equivalent. The advantage of having remote policies is that they can be easily reused, allowing organizations to create policy catalogs.

* If preferred, authors could create self-contained contracts **embedding policy specifications**. The main advantage of this method is that it ensures that the policy source cannot be changed, as it's stored and versioned within the contract:

  ```yaml
    policies:
      materials:
        - embedded: # (1)
            # Put full policy spec here
            apiVersion: workflowcontract.chainloop.dev/v1
            kind: Policy
            metadata:
              name: cve-policy
            spec:
              policies:
              - kind: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
                path: cves-cyclonedx.rego
  ```

In the example above, we can see that, when referenced by the `embedded` attribute (1), a full policy can be embedded in the contract.

### Policy arguments
Policies may accept arguments to customize its behaviour. For example, this policy matches a "quality" score against a "threshold" argument:
```yaml
# quality.yaml
apiVersion: workflowcontract.chainloop.dev/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: quality
  description: Checks for components without licenses
  annotations:
    category: sbom
spec:
  type: SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON
  embedded: |
    package main

    import rego.v1

    default threshold := 5
    threshold := to_number(input.args.threshold) # (1)

    violations contains msg if {
      input.score < threshold
      msg := sprintf("quality threshold not met %d < %d", [input.score, threshold])
    }
```

It can be instantiated with a custom `threshold` parameter, by adding a `with` property in the policy attachment in the contract:
```yaml
policies:
  materials:
    - ref: file://quality.yaml
      with:
        threshold: 6 (1)
```
(1) This is interpreted as a string, that's why we need to add `to_number` in the policy script

### Integrity Checks

Optionally, you can append the sha256 hash of the policy file content to your policy attachment reference. By doing so, the policy engine will make sure the resolved policy matches the expected hash in the contract reference.

For example

  ```yaml
  policies:
    materials: 
      # append digest to optionally check the integrity of the policy file during evaluation
      - ref: file://cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
      # It also works for http references
      - ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/main/docs/examples/policies/sbom/cyclonedx-banned-licenses.yaml@sha256:5b40425cb7bcba16ac47e3d8a8d3af7288afeeb632096994e741decedd5d38b3
  ```

## How to write a Chainloop policy
Check [this how-to](/guides/rego-policies) to know how you can write Chainloop policies in [Rego language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#learning-rego).

## Policy engine constraints (Rego)
To ensure the policy engine work as pure and as fast as possible, we have deactivated some of the OPA built-in functions. The following functions are not allowed in the policy scripts:
- `opa.runtime`
- `rego.parse_module`
- `trace`

Also `http.send` has been isolated so only requests to the following domains are allowed:
- `chainloop.dev`
- `cisa.gov`

This prevents unexpected behavior and potential remote exploits, particularly since these policies are evaluated client-side.
