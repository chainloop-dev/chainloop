## Contract Schema

## Runner Context

:::info
New runner contexts will be added over time. If yours is not implemented yet, please [contact us](https://chainloop.dev/contact)
:::

An **optional** runner type can be provided in a workflow contract.

```yaml title=skynet.contract.yaml showLineNumbers
schemaVersion: v1
materials:
  - type: CONTAINER_IMAGE
    name: skynet-control-plane
envAllowList:
  - CUSTOM_VAR
# highlight-start
runner:
  type: "GITHUB_ACTION"
# highlight-end
```

It has the following effect on the attestation process.

- **Require** the attestation process to be executed in the target runner type unless the `--dry-run` flag is set during initialization.
- **A link to the workload** (i.e Github Action Run link) **will be recorded** both in the attestation and in the control plane during initialization.
- An additional set of environment variables will be resolved in addition to the ones defined in the contract [`envAllowList`](/getting-started/workflow-definition#add-materials-to-the-contract).

Currently, we support the following runner types

### `GITHUB_ACTION`

The following environment variables will be automatically added to the attestation. For more information on what they do refer to [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables).

- `GITHUB_ACTOR`
- `GITHUB_REF`
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`
- `GITHUB_RUN_ID`
- `GITHUB_SHA`
- `RUNNER_NAME`
- `RUNNER_OS`

A link to the Github Action will be recorded in the control plane too during initialization.

### `GITLAB_PIPELINE`

The following environment variables will be automatically added to the attestation. More information about what they mean in [Gitlab's official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)

- `GITLAB_USER_EMAIL`
- `GITLAB_USER_LOGIN`
- `CI_PROJECT_URL`
- `CI_COMMIT_SHA`
- `CI_JOB_URL`
- `CI_PIPELINE_URL`
- `CI_RUNNER_VERSION`
- `CI_RUNNER_DESCRIPTION`
- `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`

A link to the Gitlab CI job will be recorded in the control plane too, during initialization.

### `AZURE_PIPELINE`

The following environment variables will be automatically added to the attestation. For more information on what they mean, refer to [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).

- `BUILD_REQUESTEDFOREMAIL`
- `BUILD_REQUESTEDFOR`
- `BUILD_REPOSITORY_URI`
- `BUILD_REPOSITORY_NAME`
- `BUILD_BUILDID`
- `BUILD_BUILDNUMBER`
- `BUILD_BUILDURI`
- `BUILD_REASON`
- `AGENT_VERSION`
- `TF_BUILD`

A link to the Azure Pipeline build will be recorded in the control plane too during initialization.

### `JENKINS_JOB`

The following environment variables will be automatically added to the attestation. For more information on how to use Jenkins environment variables, refer to [the official Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables).

- `JOB_NAME`
- `BUILD_URL`
- `GIT_BRANCH` (optional)
- `GIT_COMMIT` (optional)
- `AGENT_WORKDIR`
- `NODE_NAME`

A link to the build will be recorded in the control plane too, during initialization.

### `CIRCLECI_BUILD`

The following environment variables will be automatically added to the attestation. For more information on their meaning, refer to [the official CircleCI documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/).

- `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL`
- `CIRCLE_JOB`
- `CIRCLE_BRANCH` (optional)
- `CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL`
- `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX`

A link to the CircleCI build will be recorded in the control plane too, during initialization.

:::tip
Remember, if all the **env variables** that you need are not defined in the context, you can extend such list via the `envAllowList` option.
