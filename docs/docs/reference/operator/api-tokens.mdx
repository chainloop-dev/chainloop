title: Controlplane API Tokens
---

The Chainloop CLI is used to interact with the Chainloop Control Plane supports two authentication methods.

### User Authentication

- Meant for interactive use
- Associated with an user account
- Valid for 24 hours

They can be obtained by running the `chainloop auth login` command.

### API tokens

Alternatively, you can create Service Accounts (API Tokens) that

- Are meant for non-interactive use, i.e automation
- Are associated with a organization
- Have a customizable expiry time that can be manually revoked
- supports ACL for fine-grained access control (SOON)

You can operate on your organization API tokens using the `chainloop organization api-token` command.

```sh
$ chainloop organization api-token -h
Manage API tokens to authenticate with the Chainloop API.

Usage:
  chainloop organization api-token [command]

Aliases:
  api-token, token

Available Commands:
  create      Create an API token
  list        List API tokens in this organization
  revoke      revoke API token
```

and then they can be used by the CLI by either setting `CHAINLOOP_API_TOKEN` environment variable or by using the `--token` flag, for example

```
chainloop workflow list --token <your-token>
```
