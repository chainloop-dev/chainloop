title: Configure your deployment for keyless signing
---

Note: this is a experimental feature and subject to change in future Chainloop releases

Chainloop controlplane can be configured with a Certificate Authority (CA) to support keyless signing scenarios. In these cases,
the CLI `attestation push` command can be run without a `--key` argument. A new ephemeral sigining certificate will be issued
by the controlplane to sign the attestations as usual.

## Configuring file based CA

In this deployment mode, Chainloop can be instructed to look for a local, file-based CA that will be used to sign new certificate requests coming from the CLI.
This example shows how to issue a new CA with `openssl`.:

```bash
# create a new private key
> openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096
# generate a certificate
> openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

Then place a snippet like this in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
certificate_authority:
  file_ca:
    cert_path: "./path/to/ca.crt"
    key_path: "./path/to/ca.key"
    key_pass: {KEY_PASS}
```

Then run the controlplane and make sure that it shows this log line during bootstrap:

```
2024-05-31T13:41:41.478+0200    INFO    {"msg": "Keyless: File CA configured"}
```

## Running the CLI in keyless mode

Just omit the `--key` argument when pushing an attestation:

```bash
> chainloop --token $TOKEN att push
INF key not provided, running in key-less mode
INF push completed
...
Attestation Digest: sha256:956cf9ac20eeedac9dad76235e50b854799cf95a9fa30ec11499782a5cf39ef4%
```
