title: Use Ory Hydra as OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider
---

A requirement to run your own Chainloop instance is to configure an OIDC provider to authenticate users who interact with the control plane.

## Pre-requisites

To configure your Chainloop instance with Ory Hydra you'll need the following information:

- Ory Hydra instance running
- Access to your OIDC provider configuration

## Configure Ory Hydra

First, you'll need to have an Ory Hydra instance running. You can follow the [official documentation](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/) to set up your own instance.
Then simply create a new OAuth2 client in your Ory Hydra instance. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
$  hydra create oauth2-client --name "ACME Solutions"  --grant-type authorization_code,refresh_token --response-type code  --scope openid,email,profile  --redirect-uri http://CHAINLOOP_INSTANCE_URL/auth/callback --endpoint https://ORY_HYDRA_URL
```

Chainloop client will only request `openid`, `email` and `profile` scopes.

Relevant information that can be noted from the command signature is:
- `name`: The name of the OAuth2 client
- `grant-type`: The grant type of the client it needs to be set `authorization_code` and `refresh_token`
- `response-type`: The response type of the client: `code`
- `scope`: The scopes that the client will request: `openid`, `email`, `profile`
- `redirect-uri`: The redirect URI of the client: Whenever is the Chainloop instance URL plus `/auth/callback`
- `endpoint`: The endpoint of the Ory Hydra instance

Once the command is run, it will give back something similar to the following:

```bash
CLIENT ID       b028840e-8c54-4d01-91b9-eb2c4aa6fc0e
CLIENT SECRET   REDACTED
GRANT TYPES     authorization_code, refresh_token
RESPONSE TYPES  code
SCOPE           openid email profile
AUDIENCE
REDIRECT URIS   http://0.0.0.0:8000/auth/callback, http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
```

## Configure Chainloop deployment

As explained in the [deployment guide](../k8s), you can configure the ODIC configuration `oidc` section of the `values.yaml` file.

Just put the information we gathered from the previous steps like this.

```yaml
controlplane:
  oidc:
    url: "" # Ory Hydra URL
    clientID: "" # Ory Hydra OAuth2 client ID
    clientSecret: "" # Ory Hydra OAuth2 client secret
```

And deploy your Chainloop Control Plane with the update values to take effect.

Now your Chainloop instance will automatically authenticating users using the Ory Hydra instance you just configured.
