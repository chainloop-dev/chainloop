By default, the Chainloop CLI comes pre-configured to talk to Chainloop's platform instance, which is currently on early access. To get an account, please request access [here](https://app.chainloop.dev/request-access), and we'll get back to you shortly.

Alternatively, you can run your instance of Chainloop through our labs [docker-compose setup](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/tree/main/devel#labs-environments) or in Kubernetes following [this guide](/guides/deployment/k8s/).
