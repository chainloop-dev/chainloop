# GUAC integration

Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition ([GUAC](https://github.com/guacsec/guac)) aggregates software security metadata into a high fidelity graph databaseâ€”normalizing entity identities and mapping standard relationships between them. Querying this graph can drive higher-level organizational outcomes such as audit, policy, risk management, and even developer assistance.

This integration allows Chainloop users to automatically send attestation (DSSE envelopes / in-toto statements) and CycloneDX/SPDX Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs) to a cloud storage bucket staging area. From there, GUAC can be configured to continuously monitor and inject that data.

Currently, the integration only supports [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) (GCS) as a storage provider.

## How to use it

### Requirements

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- A GCP project with a GCS bucket
- A GCP service account with write access to the bucket. See [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for more information. 
- Once create, download the service account [JSON credentials file](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account)

### Chainloop setup

To get started, you need to register the plugin in your Chainloop organization.

```sh
$ chainloop integration registered add guac --opt bucket=[my-bucket-name] --opt credentials=[credentials-content]

# example
$ chainloop integration registered add guac --opt bucket=test-guac --opt credentials="$(cat ./service-account-devel.json)"   
```

Then, in order to use the integration, you need to attach it to a workflow by providing the IDs of the workflow and integration you just registered.

```sh
$ chainloop integration attached add --workflow $WID --integration $ID
```

That's all on the Chainloop side. Now all new attestation and SBOM metadata files will get uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.


### GUAC setup

Refer to https://github.com/guacsec/guac documentation to learn how to setup GUAC to import from a GCS-based collector.
